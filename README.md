# Countdown app in React
Based on React JS, Typescript and Material UI.
This is a simple app made to practice TS and React syntaxes as well as concepts like state lifting, passing props, binding functions, updating state with hooks, etc. 


Functionality:
 - Set date and time
 - Press the Start button
 - App counts down to the chosen date
 - While counting, the button and datetimepicker get disabled (enables after counting is finished)
